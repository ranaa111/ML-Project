# ML-Project|Breast Cancer Subtyping Using CNN-based Interpretable Deep Learning Model (EffectiveNETV2B2)


# Project Overview: 
The project aim to develop an interpretable Deep Learning Model based on Convolutional neural networks, CNNs, to easily subtype breast cancer from the histopathological images integrated with an AI tool that interprets the model prediction. The model will subtype the breast cancer into one of the following types: Phyllodes tumor, fibroadenoma, adenosis, fibroadenoma, tubular adenoma, lobular carcinoma, carcinoma, papillary carcinoma, and mucinous carcinoma.
